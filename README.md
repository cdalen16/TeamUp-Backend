# TeamUp-Backend

TeamUp is a webapp that allows users to connect with fellow classmates to form project teams. Administrators can make a post for a project in their class and students that are enrolled in that class can create teams for other students to join. The app has several important features such as user registration and login, a chat window for students to communicate, and a settings tab to update account/class information.
